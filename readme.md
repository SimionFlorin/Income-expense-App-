#Expense app

## Problem statement

As an user I want to be able to keep track of my expenses. I can add **transactions** that are 
one of the following categories:
  - income 
  - expense. 
  
 Each transaction category has a **type** that is defined as follows:
  - If category name is **income** then type is one of **salary**, **carryover** or **other**
  
  - If category name is **expense** then type is one of **Eating out**, **entertainment**, 
  **shopping**, **fuel**, **general** or **holiday**.
 
 Each category has **name** and **description** ( no more than 50 characters ).
 
 As an user I want to be able to add new category type to one of the existing categories.
 
 A transaction should have date ( that defaults to current date ), sum, category 
 and remarks ( no more than 100 characters )
